I am a third year *BSc Data Science* student at [University of Bristol](https://bristol.ac.uk), taking a *Computational Scientist* Industrial Placement at [GSK](https://gsk.com).

During my placement at *GSK*, I am co-supervised by <ins>Dr. David Marcus</ins> (GSK) and <ins>Prof. Christophe Andrieu</ins> (Bristol). My research involves *missing data imputation*, *augmentation*, and *uncertainty estimation/mitigation*, in the setting of drug discovery data.

At *University of Bristol*, I work with <ins>Dr. Song Liu</ins> on a part-time basis. My research includes *missing data imputation* by utilizing *gradient flows*.
